Lets assume that there is a set of points: P = { (0,0), (1,1), (2,0) } which is a triangular shape.
In the local polynomial approximation, it constructs a polynomial around each pointâ€™s neghborhood and obatin the tangent at that point. Therefore, for the above case, the tangents at (0,0) and other points will be a straight line. 
However, the MLS surface is obatined by smoothly interpolating the given points. So, it will approximate the points with a parabolic shape.
As a result, the tangents of the local polynomial approximation will be straight lines, while the tangents of the MLS surface will be curved. Like this example, the tangents of the local polynomial are not necessarily the tangents of the MLS surface.
